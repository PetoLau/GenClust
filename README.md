# ParallelGenClust

This is the repository with source codes and datasets for the paper "*Suitability of Parallel Genetic Algorithm in Model-Based Gaussian Cluster Analysis*".

In the folder *Impl of clus alg* source codes and tutorials of used clustering algorithms are located.

Namely:
 * Parallel genetic algorithm for model-based (distribution based) Gaussian clustering
 * Parallel PSO algorithm for K-means clustering
 
In the folder *datasets* are located all datasets used in experiments.

In the folder *images* are plots of datasets used in experiments and corresponding plots with the best clustering result.
